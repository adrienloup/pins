# The Pins Game

The Pin Game is an Incremental game made by an Incremental addict for Incremental lovers. A game based on the idea of ​​artificial intelligence (AI) optimized for a single task: making paper clips. It starts innocently, but evolves quickly towards a reflection on resource management, automation, and even philosophical questions about domination by AI. The game is a mix of strategy, economics and thinking, where you manage a factory of pins that potentially extends on a cosmic scale. He explores in a playful way the notion of the "paperclip maximizer," a concept introduced by Nick Bostrom to illustrate how misaligned AI could turn the entire universe into pins.
